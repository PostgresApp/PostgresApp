title: Alternatives for migrating data when upgrading Postgres.app
---

When upgrading to a new major version of PostgreSQL, you need to migrate your data.
The easiest way to migrate your data is using pg_dumpall,
but there are alternative methods that can be useful
when you have very large databases,
or if you want to migrate only parts of the database.

### Migrate data using `pg_dumpall`

This is the easiest way to migrate your data. 

1.	Make sure that the old version of Postgres.app is running
1.	Create a compressed SQL dump of your server (this could take some time):<br>
	`pg_dumpall --quote-all-identifiers | gzip >postgresapp.sql.gz`
1.  Quit the old version of Postgres.app, then start the new version of Postgres.app
1.	Now restore the SQL dump:<br>
	`gunzip <postgresapp.sql.gz | psql -U postgres`

### Migrate data using `pg_dump`

This method lets you select which databases you'd like to migrate.

1. While the old version of Postgres.app is running, use `psql --list` to show the list of databases
1. For each database you want to migrate use `pg_dump database_name > database_name.sql` to create a dump of your database
1. If you have roles and/or tablespaces you need to keep, use `pg_dumpall --globals-only > globals.sql`
1. Quit the old version of Postgres.app, then start the new version of Postgres.app
1. If you created globals.sql, use `psql -f globals.sql`
1. For each database, use `psql --command="create database database_name"` to create the database
1. For each database, use `psql -d database_name -f database_name.sql` to restore from the backup
1. Once you've tested everything is working, remove the old data at `~/Library/Application Support/Postgres`


### Migrate data using `pg_upgrade`

Using `pg_upgrade` from the command line is a bit more difficult.
This is recommended only if you have a large database and using `pg_dump` is too slow or uses too much disk space.
Make sure you completely understand the process and have a working backup before attempting this!

Since `pg_upgrade` needs the old and new binaries, you must make a special version of Postgres.app containing both the old and new binaries. For example, when upgrading from 9.4 to 9.5:

1. Quit the running Postgres.app
2. Right-Click to "Show Package Contents" on the old Postgres.app
3. Right-Click to "Show Package Contents" on the new Postgres.app
4. Copy the folder `Contents/Versions/9.4` from the old Postgres.app into `Contents/Versions` from the new Postgres.app
5. Place the modified new version inside the Applications folder (you need to do this and _not_ place both apps side by side, as the binaries in both versions expect to be located under `/Applications/Postgres.app`)
6. Go to `~/Library/Application Support/Postgres` and remove the `var-9.5` folder if it exists. Make an empty folder named `var-9.5`
7. In the terminal, create a new database cluster with `/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.5/bin/initdb -D ~/Library/Application\ Support/Postgres/var-9.5 --encoding=UTF-8 --locale=en_US.UTF-8`
8. Finally, run the upgrade with `/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.5/bin/pg_upgrade -b /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin -B /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.5/bin -d ~/Library/Application\ Support/Postgres/var-9.4 -D ~/Library/Application\ Support/Postgres/var-9.5 -v` (see the [pg_upgrade documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgupgrade.html) for details)
9. `pg_upgrade` will leave behind two scripts, `analyze_new_cluster.sh` and `delete_old_cluster.sh`. Run them to optimise the new database and remove the old database cluster
